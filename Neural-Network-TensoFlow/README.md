## Introduction
This repository provides a TensorFlow implementation of a neural network-based model for protein function prediction. Protein function prediction is a critical task in bioinformatics, aiming to infer the functional properties and characteristics of proteins based on their amino acid sequences. By leveraging the power of neural networks and TensorFlow, this implementation enables accurate and efficient prediction of protein functions, facilitating advancements in drug discovery, protein engineering, and biological research.
## Features
The TensorFlow implementation for protein function prediction offers the following features:
1. **Neural Network Architecture:** The model utilizes a neural network architecture designed for protein function prediction. It incorporates multiple layers, such as the input layer, fully connected hidden layers, and output layer, to capture complex relationships and patterns in the protein sequences.
2. **Sequence Encoding:** The implementation includes the data obtained from using a pre-trained model for encoding protein sequences into numerical representations that can be fed into the neural network.
3. **Training and Evaluation:** The code provides functionality for training the neural network model using labeled protein sequences. It includes the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function to efficiently learn the underlying patterns in the data. Additionally, evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, and AUC are implemented to assess the model's performance on validation or test data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The code allows for fine-tuning of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, epoch, and network architecture parameters. This flexibility enables optimal performance of the model by adapting to different datasets and prediction tasks.
5. **Model Deployment:** Once trained, the model can be saved and deployed for making predictions on new protein sequences.
